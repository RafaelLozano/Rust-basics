# Rust-basics
This repository is a space dedicated to documenting my process of learning the Rust programming language.

## History of Rust
Rust was initially designed and developed by former Mozilla employee Graydon Hoare as a personal project. Mozilla began sponsoring the project in 2009 and announced it in 2010. But the first stable release, Rust 1.0 was released on May 15, 2015.

Since the initial stable release, the language has seen a series of improvements every three years through new editions; Rust 2015 with the release of Rust 1.0, Rust 2018, and Rust 2021. Each edition ensured backward compatibility with existing code.

## Installation 
There are many ways to install Rust on your system. For the moment the official way to install Rust is using [Rustup](https://rustup.rs/).

Rustup installs rustc, cargo, rustup and other standard tools to Cargoâ€™s bin directory.
- Unix it is located at $HOME/.cargo/bin 
- Windows at %USERPROFILE%\.cargo\bin. 

This is the same directory that cargo install will install Rust programs and Cargo plugins.
